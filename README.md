# Alice Home Manager

Alice is intended to be a tool for organizing finances, chores, and various other logistics between roommates or families.

Instead, it is currently just a relic of me experimenting with Backbone.js on Rails, etc.

You can see the application running, FWIW, at http://justalicious.com/

User signup not fully implemented, log in as 

* U: {user1|user2|user3}@justalicious.com

to see what there is to be seen.
